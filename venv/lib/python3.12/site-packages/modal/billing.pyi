        that billing can be attributed to (e.g., an App) along with metadata (including user-defined
        tags) for identifying that object. The dictionary also contains a breakdown of the cost value

        etc.). The specific resource types included in the breakdown are subject to change as
        Modal's billing model evolves.

        timezone-naive (which will be interpreted as UTC times). The timestamps in the result will
        be in UTC. Cost will be reported for full intervals, even if the provided `start` or `end`
        parameters are partial: `start` will be rounded to the beginning of its interval, while
        partial `end` intervals will be excluded.

        Additional user-provided metadata can be included in the report if the objects have tags
        and `tag_names` (i.e., keys) are specified in the request. Alternatively, pass `tag_names=["*"]`

        if they were added or removed at some point within it. If the tag name was not in use during an
        interval, it will be absent from the tags dictionary in that output row.

        It's also possible to generate reports using the
        [`modal billing report`](https://modal.com/docs/cli/latest/billing) CLI command. The CLI
