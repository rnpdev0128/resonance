    The queue can contain any object serializable by `cloudpickle`, including Modal objects.

    By default, the `Queue` object acts as a single FIFO queue which supports puts and gets (blocking and non-blocking).

    Examples:
        ```python

            # Default and "foo" partition are ignored by the get operation.
            assert my_queue.get(partition="bar") == 2

            # Set custom 10s expiration time on "foo" partition.
            my_queue.put(3, partition="foo", partition_ttl=10)

            # Iterate through items in place (read immutably)
            my_queue.put(1)
            assert [v for v in my_queue.iterate()] == [0, 1]

        # You can also create persistent queues that can be used across apps
        queue = Queue.from_name("my-persisted-queue", create_if_missing=True)
        queue.put(42)
        assert queue.get() == 42
        ```

        For more examples, see the [guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/dicts-and-queues#modal-queues).

        **Queue partitions**

        Specifying partition keys gives access to other independent FIFO partitions within the same `Queue` object.
        Across any two partitions, puts and gets are completely independent.
        For example, a put in one partition does not affect a get in any other partition.

        When no partition key is specified (by default), puts and gets will operate on a default partition.
        This default partition is also isolated from all other partitions.
        Please see the Usage section below for an example using partitions.

        **Lifetime of a queue and its partitions**

        By default, each partition is cleared 24 hours after the last `put` operation.
        A lower TTL can be specified by the `partition_ttl` argument in the `put` or `put_many` methods.
        Each partition's expiry is handled independently.

        As such, `Queue`s are best used for communication between active functions and not relied on for persistent
        storage.

        On app completion or after stopping an app any associated `Queue` objects are cleaned up.
        All its partitions will be cleared.

        **Limits**

        A single `Queue` can contain up to 100,000 partitions, each with up to 5,000 items. Each item can be up to
        1 MiB.

        Partition keys must be non-empty and must not exceed 64 bytes.

    The queue can contain any object serializable by `cloudpickle`, including Modal objects.

        For more examples, see the [guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/dicts-and-queues#modal-queues).

        **Queue partitions**

        Specifying partition keys gives access to other independent FIFO partitions within the same `Queue` object.
        Across any two partitions, puts and gets are completely independent.
        For example, a put in one partition does not affect a get in any other partition.

        When no partition key is specified (by default), puts and gets will operate on a default partition.
        This default partition is also isolated from all other partitions.
        Please see the Usage section below for an example using partitions.

        **Lifetime of a queue and its partitions**

        By default, each partition is cleared 24 hours after the last `put` operation.
        A lower TTL can be specified by the `partition_ttl` argument in the `put` or `put_many` methods.
        Each partition's expiry is handled independently.

        As such, `Queue`s are best used for communication between active functions and not relied on for persistent
        storage.

        On app completion or after stopping an app any associated `Queue` objects are cleaned up.
        All its partitions will be cleared.

        **Limits**

        A single `Queue` can contain up to 100,000 partitions, each with up to 5,000 items. Each item can be up to
        1 MiB.

        Partition keys must be non-empty and must not exceed 64 bytes.
