            `remote_path` must be an absolute path in the Sandbox. If it points
            to a file, events for that file are reported. If it points to a
            directory, events for entries directly inside it are reported. Set
            `recursive=True` to also receive events for all nested subdirectories.
            If `remote_path` is a symlink, it is followed and events reference
            paths under the resolved target.

            Yields `FileWatchEvent` objects as changes occur, until either
            `timeout` seconds elapse, the iterator is closed, or the Sandbox
            is terminated.

            Optionally restrict the kinds of events emitted to those included
            in `filter`. The default filter `None` permits all event types.

            `timeout` is in seconds. `None` means watch indefinitely. When
            `timeout` elapses, the iterator stops without raising an exception.
